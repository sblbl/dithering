## How it works

Image dithering is a processing technique that, usually, converts a color or grayscale image into a black and white one. 
The most naïve approach for dithering is _threshold_, that simply convert a pixel value to black (0) or white (255) according to its value with respect of a threshold (usually 128, half of the number of gray tones that is 256). This strategy, however, produces high-contrast images where a lot of detail is lost.
