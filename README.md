## How it works

Image dithering is a processing technique that, usually, converts a color or grayscale image into a black and white one. Transformations like dithering treat images as bidimensional matrixes with a number of columns and rows equal to their width and height. Each element in this matrix contains the color value of one pixel.

The most naïve approach for dithering is _threshold_, that simply convert a pixel value to black (0) or white (255) according to its value with respect of a threshold (usually 128, half of the number of gray tones that is 256). This strategy, however, produces high-contrast images where a lot of detail is lost.

Dithering with error diffusion, instead, diffuses the _quantisation error_ among pixels, that is the error of the approximation from grayscale to bitmap of a pixel is distributed among the surrounding pixels. Many error diffusion methods are available, and among them one of the most used is Loyd-Steinberg dithering.

### Loyd-Steinberg dithering

Loyd-Steinberg dithering proceeds from left to right, and from top to bottom of an image, one pixel at a time.

                <td>11</td>
                <td>12</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>13</td>
                <td>14</td>
                <td>15</td>

When a pixel is processed by the algorithm, its grayscale value (0-255) is compared to a threshold, in this case 128; if the value is greater than the threshold, the pixel becomes white (255), otherwhise black (0).
